The CSS Box Model describes the rectangular boxes that are generated for elements in the document tree and laid out according to the visual formatting model. Each box has a content area (e.g. text, an image, etc.), and optional surrounding `padding`, `border`, and `margin` areas.

The CSS Box Model is responsible for calculating:
- How much space a block element takes up.
- Whether or not borders and/or margins overlap, or collapse.
- A box's dimensions.
